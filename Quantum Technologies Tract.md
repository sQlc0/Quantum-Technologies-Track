### Proposal:

Addition of Quantum Technologies Track for the QIS Master's Program at Indiana University

### Overview: 
Indiana Universityâ€™s QIS Master's program has been successful in preparing students for careers in the rapidly expanding quantum industry. However, to stay competitive with other universities and to better prepare students for the diverse job opportunities in the quantum industry, I propose adding a Quantum Technologies track to the program. This track is designed to provide a broad understanding of quantum technologies and their applications, while also providing a foundation in quantum theory and programming. This track is aimed at students without a background in physics, mathematics, or computer science and will lower the barrier of entry to the QIS industry and is intended to be programming and project oriented, as these are the skills and experience being looked for in industry.

### Core Courses: 
The Quantum Technologies track will include 15 hours of core credits. The 5 core courses that will be included in the track are:
	1.  Quantum Information Science (P555): This course will provide a broad overview of quantum information science, covering the basic concepts and principles of quantum mechanics, quantum computation, and quantum communication.
	2. Introduction to Quantum Computing (C290): This course will provide a foundation in quantum computing, covering topics such as qubits, quantum gates, quantum algorithms, and quantum error correction.

### Proposed Courses:
In addition to the core courses, the Quantum Technologies track will include three proposed core courses: (Quantum Entrepreneurship will not be classified as a Core course, it is proposed to keep pace with other universities)

1.  Quantum Technologies Seminar: This course will provide an in-depth look at the different quantum technologies and their applications. Topics may include quantum sensing, quantum cryptography, quantum simulation, and quantum machine learning. This course will also include guest lectures from industry members and quantum education specialists.
    
2.  Quantum Applications and Devices: This course will provide students with a comprehensive introduction to the design, operation, and application of quantum devices. The course will cover a range of topics, including superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and photonic systems, as well as quantum sensors, amplifiers, and transducers. This course will also cover topics such as quantum metrology, quantum sensing, and quantum communication.
    
3.  Quantum Programming: This course will provide an advanced exposure to programming quantum computers using Qiskit and PennyLane, popular open-source quantum computing frameworks. Students will learn how to write quantum circuits, simulate quantum algorithms, and run them on real quantum computers. This course is different from C290 in that it will strictly focus on advanced quantum algorithms and their practical, and industrial applications. Not only will it give them experience which aids in understanding, posting advanced projects like the ones in this class to public repositories like GitHub will grow the community and show future employers students knowledge bases. 
### Rationale
The overarching perspective those in industry have in regards to incoming "mid-range" quantum talent is one of pragmatism. Proposed changes to the IUB QISMS Program are motivated by this influence from industry. 

A base case can be made as such: a student whom just graduated with a business degree applies and is admitted to the QISMS program with no knowledge of mathematics, physics, computer science or coding, realistic applications of quantum technology, nor context for these technologies other than "buzz-word soup" they have consumed through media. 

The ability for this individual to successfully navigate the currently only required course for this degree, P555, is severely limited. Not impossible, however, it maybe enough to effectively "scare" a number of prospective students away from the coming quantum wave. Thus driving numbers of students from non-math oriented background entering the quantum workforce downward. The need for diverse quantum talent is acknowledged but unrealized within industry currently.

By generalizing the quantum education via the proposed courses, the student will immediately be immersed in the quantum-industrial mindset and the 'solutions above all' framework, which gets lost when the only thing 'quantum' the student studies is theory. Not to say that it is not a crucial component, as is self-evident.  

In order to facilitate the acceleration of contextualizing the quantum industry and the students future role within it, the quantum "bootcamp", C290, should be moved into the "Required" category along with being moved to the fall semester. Through experience and discussions, the structure of this class is relatively fluid and dynamic. There were a number of students in my section of class who complained it was "to focused on math and Latex". The class then moved to a more conceptual approach. In the moment I appreciated the change in style, however, after the remainder of my time in the QISMS, I had the realization that I, not to speak for others, would have benefited tremendously from a more rigorous approach to the material. Exploration of these concepts in this way 'rips off the band-aid' in opposition to the 'dip your toe in' method. Running these classes in paralelle would further reinforce the QIS-community IU wishes to foster for the incoming students. Add to that the required involvement with QuTE, the Indiana University quantum club, the exchanging of ideas regarding quantum concepts lends itself to furthering the spirit of community and the increasing in knowledge.

Getting a more clear and concise understanding of how the majority of the workforce will interface with quantum technologies (Qiskit, PL, etc.) not only aids in context building but aids in understanding the more theoretical aspects of quantum technologies. For our base case, it would expose them to a large portion of the real-world and less heady areas where they may feel more suited given their talents and interests. In this fashion their first exposure to quantum computing would not be an equation for which they have no context to understand or care about, but a high level survey of the workforce they will be joining and where they may fit within it.

The tensile strength and melting point of iron are not needed to swing a hammer.

By focusing the Quantum Technologies track on project and discussion oriented classes, we cater to the realities of industry by instructing students how to swing a hammer.

The proposed seminar class not only has support in that across multiple alternative QIS programs globally, there are courses similar being required. But also in that pragmatically speaking it addresses multiple issues. By not having a required course that covers every aspect of the quantum industry, our students are undertrained compared to candidates from other universities in the eyes of organizations looking to hire. This will look good on the university in a "long term, big picture" manner, while benefiting the student by forcing them to stay current on happenings in industry, further reinforcing the Context Building methodology this track will be implementing, thus increasing their skill and ability to contribute meaningfully. 

Industry trends move quicker than academia can keep up with. By having a degree track specifically tailored to the needs of industry, and by continuing to fostering these relationships with industry partners via the QEDC and CQT, the Quantum Technology track will be able to more quickly maneuver and adjust to the realities of the market. Reading papers on a vast number of quantum topics and completing tutorials on currently industry-supported information and technologies, in a similar fashion will increase the base knowledge more rapidly then if left to their own devices, making the activation energy for the more difficult concepts lessened. The current flexibility of the QISMS program, while inspired, does have drawbacks that could not have been foreseen prior to measurement. This lack of context and "hands on" experience may lead to very brief pre-interview conversations, if the worst case is to be assumed. The goal of the Quantum Technologies track is to fill in the areas not covered by the other three tracks and to act as a glue that holds the whole program together.
 
It is this train of thought that lead to the following two proposed core courses.  
  
P555 emphasizes quantum theory within the quantum circuit framework of computation, while only briefly touching on concepts like measurement based and topological quantum computing. A student will be blindly unprepared for concepts outside of the fundamental learning structure that has been used in universities hitherto. Quantum Applications and Devices, also has global support by being a required course or some variation thereof, at multiple universities offering QISMS degrees. This course will cover a high level look at the breadth of quantum technologies and devices used in support of those technologies while simultaneously exposing them to the manner in which technologists in industry speak, think, and work with quantum technology. Subjects covered include, but are not limited to; photonic systems, annealing, topological quantum computing, sensing, communication, and novel algorithms. This course will consist of 8 homework assignments consisting of tutorials on quantum mechanics, quantum computing, etc., as well as assigned reading focusing on varying aspects of the developing field and seminal papers as a foundation. There will also be four quizzes given over the semester. All of which have been written and answer keys made.  
  
Quantum Programming, the last proposed required course, will be an extension of C290 in that it it will focus specifically on the advanced algorithms that are not covered in C290 and are more prominently used within industry and academic research. Moreover, this class will be split into two sections. The first being Qiskit and the second being PennyLane. Qiskit currently, and for the foreseeable future has the largest active community of any quantum computing framework. Its versatility and ease of use make it the ideal first quantum language to become familiar with. PennyLane by Xanadu, on the other hand is more tailored for practical use in quantum algorithms and is considered to be the language of choice when working specifically with quantum machine learning applications. It will be imperative for future IU QISMS students to have a diverse set of quantum-skills if they are to be considered for the 'mid-range' quantum career opportunities offered by industry at this point in time. By teaching the advanced algorithms in multiple languages, it reinforces all of the concepts established in the first semester, while building new *practical working knowledge* with technologies implemented by industry every day. This course will also have homework, quizzes, and multiple small projects, and one large semester project.  
  
By showing the students what they should know, the guess work is eliminated on their part, further reducing anxiety regarding post-graduation. The quantum technologies track is a multilayered approach to solving a multilayered problem. How does one turn a non-quantum folk, into someone who not only speaks the lingo, but understands when, where, and how to use it? I am unsure if this query hasÂ  one-size fits all answer, however, through my experience and communications with those in industry, I believe this proposed Quantum Technologies option is a step in the right direction. 

It will be imperative that the QISMS students actively participate in the community and involve themselves with as many members in industry as possible, from as early on as possible. One of the most powerful tools I have ever been introduced to is LinkedIn. While I was a student at a cybersecurity 'bootcamp' prior to attending IU, the *very* first thing they had students do, even before class started was create a LinkedIn profile and add as many people in the field we wanted to enter as possible. This subsequently led to me discovering quantum computing and starting my journey. Networking form the the industry perspective is something that should be emphasized heavily, as the "hidden job market" in quantum computing is larger than the open job market. A specialized Career Services Department for QISMS students should be developed and implemented in order to help students navigate this brand new job market. This will initially need to be paired with Luddy CS and Physics CS until such a time that it is able to stand on it's own. However, due to the unique aspects of the quantum landscape, it will indeed need to be separate as neither career services department will have all of the answers or any at all. The need for the QISMS degree to have a strong community component cannot be over stated enough.
